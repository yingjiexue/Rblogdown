## Prictice One

Hey guys. I am Lucy from SISU. Today I'd like to talk about American TV series. when I was in college, once it was time to grab a meal.I would joyfully rush to the cafeteria, sit in corner and start watching an episode. Watching TV series is an incredible way to learn English, You get to know how native speaker and what they talk about. In this video I will share with you what. Make sure to stay still the end, today I'm bringing you 6 binge-worthy series which are new and well received. They contain very daily topics and easy to learn English whit.

No.1 is We Are Bears. The show follows three bears: Grizzly, panda and ice bear, and their awkward attempts at integrating with the human world. Suitable for both kids and adults

No.2 is Love life. It is about a young lady's journey from first love to lasting love. This show is less known but it's definitely a feel-good one

No.3 is Modern Love. Adapted from a column in the New York Times. About love,loss and redemption. A very popular one.

No.4 is Young Sheldon. It is a spin-off prequel to the Big Bang Theory. Though the young Sheldon is still quite nerdy, his pronunciation is much clearer and easier to imitate.

No.5 is This Is Us. This is indeed a tearjerker. A warm and healing family drama.

No.6 is The Morning Show. A candid drama that looks at the modern workplace. About men and women. About hierarchy. Very gripping.

**How to watch**

The real difference between watching for fun and for English learning lies in whether or not you watch them several times. For the first time, you can watch the show with Chinese and English subtitles and just relax. If you find any expression you don't know or think are worth memorizing , take screenshots or take notes by hand. For the second time, since you're already familiar with the plot, try to cover up the subtitles and let's say with a note. If you can't get it when listening, you may take a look at the subtitle, or if you'll find it troublesome to pause from time to time, you can save it until the end to keep notes all together. For the third time, listen to the audio only and identify almost every word clearly. That's actually the case for every English learning material.

Share with me your favorite American TV series. Happy watching and enjoy!

## Reading 

Of all the creatures on the earth, the Australian **platypus**, Omithorbynchusparadoxus, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and **reclusive**. Derived from the Latin platys meaning ‘flat and broad’ and pous meaning ‘foot’, the platypus has long been an **iconic** symbol of Australia. Upon being discovered in Australia in the 1700s, **sketches** of this unusual creature were made and sent back to England whereupon they were considered by experts to be a **hoax**. Indeed, the incredible collection of its body parts – broad, flat tail, rubbery snout, webbed feet and short dense fur – make it one of the world’s most unusual animals.

> 在地球上的所有生物中，澳大利亚**鸭嘴兽**（Omithorbynchusparadoxus）可能是最神秘和最**隐蔽**的生物之一。鸭嘴兽源自拉丁语platys，意思是 "平坦和宽阔"，pous的意思是 "脚"，长期以来一直是澳大利亚的一个**标志性**符号。17世纪在澳大利亚被发现后，人们为这种不寻常的生物画了**草图**，并寄回英国，结果被专家认为是一个**骗局**。事实上，它的身体部分令人难以置信的集合--宽而平的尾巴、橡胶的鼻子、有蹼的脚和短而密的毛发--使它成为世界上最不寻常的动物之一。

> **reclusive adj. 隐居的** 

>  **iconic  adj.  偶像的，图符的，象征性的** 

>  **sketcher  n. 作素描者；舞台布景设计者** 

>  **hoax  n. 恶作剧，欺骗 v. 欺骗 捉弄**


Officially classified as a mammal, the egg-laying platypus is mostly active during the night, a **nocturnal** animal. As if this combination of characteristics and behaviours were not unusual enough, the platypus is the only Australian mammal known to be **venomous**. The male platypus has a sharply pointed, moveable **spur** on its hind foot which delivers a poison capable of killing smaller animals and causing severe pain to humans. The spur – about 2 centimetres in length – is quite similar to the **fang** of a snake and, if **provoked**, is used as a means of defence. Those who have been stung by a platypus’ spur report an immediate **swelling** around the wound followed by increased swelling throughout the affected **limb**. **Excruciating**, almost paralysing pain in the affected area accompanies the sting which, in some **victims** has been known to last for a period of months. One report from a victim who was stung in the palm of the hand states that “…the spur could not be pulled out of the hand until the platypus was killed.” During the breeding season, the amount of venom in the male platypus increases. This has led some zoologists to theorise that the poisonous spur is primarily for asserting dominance amongst fellow-males. To be stung by a male platypus is a rare event with only a very small number of people being on the receiving end of this most reclusive creature.


>鸭嘴兽被正式归类为哺乳动物，它主要在夜间活动，是一种**夜行**动物。如果这种特征和行为的组合还不够特别，鸭嘴兽是澳大利亚唯一已知的**有毒的**哺乳动物。雄性鸭嘴兽的后脚上有一个尖锐的、可移动的**尖刺**，它的毒液能够杀死较小的动物，并对人类造成严重的痛苦。该刺--约2厘米长--与蛇的**獠牙**非常相似，如果受到**挑衅**，会被用作一种防御手段。那些被鸭嘴兽的尖刺刺伤的人报告说，伤口周围立即**肿胀**，随后整个受影响的**肢体**也肿胀起来。在被蜇的同时，受影响的部位会出现**令人难受的**、几乎瘫痪的疼痛，有些**受害者**的疼痛已经持续了几个月之久。一位被蜇伤手掌的受害者报告说："......直到鸭嘴兽被杀死，才能把刺从手掌中拔出来。" 在繁殖季节，雄鸭嘴兽体内的毒液量增加。这使得一些动物学家推断，毒刺主要是为了在雄性同类中宣示统治地位。被雄性鸭嘴兽蜇伤是一个罕见的事件，只有极少数人受到这种最隐蔽的生物的伤害

In the same area of the **hind** foot where the male has the poisonous spur, the female platypus only develops two **buds** which drop off in their first year of life never to appear again. The female platypus produces **a clutch of** one to three eggs in late winter or spring, **incubating** them in an underground **burrow**. The eggs are 15-18 millimetres long and have a **whitish**, papery shell like those of **lizards** and snakes. The mother is believed to keep the eggs warm by placing them between her lower belly and curled-up tail for a period of about 10 or 11 days as she rests in an underground nest made of leaves or other vegetation collected from the water. The baby platypus drinks a rich milk which is secreted from two round patches of skin midway along the mother’s bell)’. It is believed that a baby platypus feeds by **slurping up** milk with rhythmic sweeps of its stubby bill. When the juveniles first enter the water at the age of about four months, they are nearly (80-90%) as long as an adult. Male platypus do not help to raise the young.

> 在雄性鸭嘴兽**后**脚的同一区域有毒刺，雌性鸭嘴兽只长出两个**芽**，在它们出生后的第一年就会脱落，再也不会出现。雌鸭嘴兽在冬末或春季生产一**窝**1至3个蛋，在地下洞穴中**孵化**。蛋长15-18毫米，有一个像**蜥蜴**和蛇一样的**白色**纸壳。据信，当母鸭嘴兽在用树叶或从水中收集的其他植被制成的地下巢中休息时，会将蛋放在它的下腹部和蜷缩的尾巴之间，以保持温暖，时间约为10或11天。鸭嘴兽宝宝**喝**一种丰富的乳汁，这种乳汁是从母亲的铃铛中间的两块圆形皮肤上分泌出来的。据认为，鸭嘴兽宝宝的进食方式是用它那粗壮的喙有节奏地扫过，啜饮牛奶。当幼年鸭嘴兽在大约四个月大的时候第一次进入水中，它们几乎（80-90%）与成年鸭嘴兽一样长。雄性鸭嘴兽不帮助抚养幼崽。

In Australia, the platypus is officially classified as ‘Common but Vulnerable’. As a species, it is not currently considered to be endangered. However, platypus populations are believed to have declined or disappeared in many **catchments** 1, particularly in urban and agricultural landscapes. In most cases, the specific underlying reasons for the reduction in numbers remain unknown. Platypus surveys have only been carried out in a few catchments in eastern Australia. It is therefore impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the total number of platypus remaining in the wild. Based on recent studies, the average platypus population density along relatively good quality streams in the **foothills** of Victoria’s Great Dividing Range is only around one to two animals per kilometre of channel. Because platypus are predators near the top of the food chain and require large amounts of food to survive (up to about 30% of a given animal’s body weight each day), it is believed that their numbers are most often limited by the availability of food, mainly in the form of bottom-dwelling aquatic invertebrates such as shrimps, worms, yabbies, pea-shell mussels, and immature and adult aquatic insects. Small frogs and fish eggs are also eaten occasionally, along with some terrestrial insects that fall into the water from overhanging vegetation.

> 在澳大利亚，鸭嘴兽被正式列为"常见但易危"。作为一个物种，它目前不被认为是濒危的。然而，据信鸭嘴兽的数量在许多**流域**已经减少或消失，特别是在城市和农业地区。在大多数情况下，数量减少的具体根本原因仍然不明。鸭嘴兽调查只在澳大利亚东部的几个流域进行过。因此，不可能对野生鸭嘴兽的总数量做出准确的估计。根据最近的研究，在维多利亚州大分水岭山麓相对优质的溪流中，鸭嘴兽的平均种群密度仅为每公里河道1至2只左右。由于鸭嘴兽是接近食物链顶端的食肉动物，需要大量的食物来生存（每天约占某一动物体重的30%），人们认为它们的数量最常受到食物供应的限制，主要是底栖水生无脊椎动物，如虾、蠕虫、雅贝、豌豆壳蚌以及未成熟和成年水生昆虫。偶尔也会吃小青蛙和鱼卵，以及一些从悬垂的植被上落入水中的陆生昆虫。

> **catchment  n. 流域；集水**

> **foothills  n. 丘陵地带**

1: Catchments are an area of land drained by a creek or river system, or a place set aside for collecting water which runs off the surface of the land.

Until the early twentieth century, platypus were widely killed for their fur. The species is now protected by law throughout Australia. Platypus are wild animals with specialised living requirements. It is illegal for members of the public to keep them in **captivity**. A platypus which has been accidentally captured along a stream or found wandering in an unusual place should never be taken home and treated as a pet, even for a brief time. The animal will not survive the experience. Only a small number of Australian zoos and universities hold a permit to maintain platypus in captivity for **legitimate** display or research purposes. Current Australian government policy does not allow’ this species to be taken overseas for any reason.

> 直到二十世纪初，鸭嘴兽因其毛皮而被广泛杀害。现在，该物种在澳大利亚各地受到法律保护。鸭嘴兽是具有特殊生活要求的野生动物。市民**圈养**它们是非法的。鸭嘴兽在小河边被意外捕获或在一个不寻常的地方被发现游荡时，千万不要把它带回家当作宠物，即使是短暂的时间。这种动物将无法在这种经历中存活下来。只有少数澳大利亚动物园和大学持有许可，可以为合法的展示或研究目的圈养鸭嘴兽。澳大利亚政府目前的政策不允许以任何理由将该物种带到海外。

> **captivity   n. 囚禁；被关**

> **legitimate  adj. 合法的**


## FLIGHT OF THE HONEY

  Honeybees are characterised by their ability to produce **liquefied** sugar (honey) and a **propensity** to construct colonial nests using **wax**, two tasks that **necessitate** a significant level of social integration among members. As a result, they maintain strict divisions of labour, based on sex, with all males functioning as **drones** to **fertilize** and care for the eggs, and all females, with the exception of the single **fertile** queen, responsible for fetching nectar for the colony’s progeny. In addition, honeybees have devised a sophisticated system of communication to relay important information from member to member.
    
> 蜜蜂的特点是它们能够生产**液化**糖（蜂蜜），并**倾向**于用蜡建造殖民地的巢，这两项任务要求成员之间有相当程度的社会融合。因此，它们保持着严格的劳动分工，以性别为基础，所有的雄蜂负责受精和照顾卵子，而所有的雌蜂，除了唯一能生育的蜂王外，负责为蜂群的后代采蜜。此外，蜜蜂还设计了一套复杂的通信系统，在成员之间传递重要信息。

> **liquefied  adj.液化的 v.液化**

> **propensity n.倾向，习性**

> **wax  n. 蜡**

> **necessitate v.使成为必需，需要；迫使**

> **drone  v.雄峰**

> **fertilize v.使受精；使肥沃**


Perhaps the most **intriguing** feature of honeybee communication is a series of flight moves only performed by a female worker bee that has returned to the nest with **nectar** and needs to tell the rest of her colony that she has discovered food supplies and where they can be found. This so-called honeybee dance was first interpreted by German zoologist Karl von Frisch in the early 1970s. To facilitate observation, von Frisch and his students built several glass walled hives and marked a collection of worker bees, or foragers, with paint. He then trained those foragers to find nectar at designated sources at various distances from the **hives**, and when the bees returned he carefully recorded their movements, the angle and direction of their flight, and any additional visual cues offered to the colony. What von Frisch discovered was that each aspect of the dance indicated certain details about the location of the nectar reserves and recruited others to return to the site.

> 也许蜜蜂交流的**最耐人寻味**的特点是一系列的飞行动作，只有带着**花蜜**回巢的雌性工蜂才会做，并且需要告诉蜂群的其他成员她已经发现了食物供应以及在哪里可以找到它们。这种所谓的蜜蜂舞蹈是由德国动物学家卡尔-冯-弗里施在20世纪70年代初首次解释的。为了便于观察，冯-弗里施和他的学生建造了几个玻璃墙的蜂巢，并用油漆标记了一批工蜂，或觅食者。然后，他训练这些觅食者在离**蜂巢**不同距离的指定地点寻找花蜜，当蜜蜂返回时，他仔细记录它们的动作、飞行的角度和方向，以及向蜂群提供的任何其他视觉线索。冯-弗里施发现，舞蹈的每个方面都表明了关于花蜜储备位置的某些细节，并招募其他蜜蜂返回该地点。

> **intriguing adj.非常有趣的，引人入胜的; v.引起……的兴趣；策划阴谋；私通** 

> **nectar n.花蜜；果汁;琼浆；甘美的饮料**

> **hive n.蜂房，蜂箱；蜂群；**



The first piece of information conveyed by dancing bees is the distance of the field to the hive, and they do this in one of three ways. If it is less than 50 meters from the colony’s nest the bee will fly around in narrow circles, and then suddenly fly in the opposite direction. She will repeat this pattern, which von Frisch’s team called the round dance, until she has recruited several other workers to return with her to the field. When the distance is greater than 50 meters, but less than 150 meters, she will perform a **sickle** dance, a **crescent** shaped flight course. If the field is farther than 150 meters, the forager will act out a **waggle** dance in which she will run straight ahead briefly before returning to her original position in a semi-circular movement. Then, she will run forward again and return from the opposite side. The length of the forward run **coincides** with the distance of the food supplies; for example, a 2.5 second run indicates that the nectar was found about 2500 meters way.


> 跳舞的蜜蜂传达的第一条信息是田地与蜂巢的距离，它们通过三种方式之一来实现。如果它离蜂群的巢穴不到50米，蜜蜂会绕着狭窄的圆圈飞行，然后突然向相反的方向飞去。她会重复这种模式，冯-弗里施的团队称之为圆舞曲，直到她招募了其他几只工蜂和她一起回到野外。当距离大于50米，但小于150米时，她会进行**镰刀**舞，即新月形的飞行路线。如果田地的距离超过150米，觅食者会表演**摇摆舞**，她会短暂地向前跑，然后以半圆形的运动方式返回到原来的位置。然后，她会再次向前跑，并从另一侧返回。向前跑的长度与食物供应的距离相**吻合**；例如，2.5秒的跑步表示发现花蜜的距离约为2500米。

> **sickle n.镰刀; adj.镰刀型的**

> **crescent n. 新月型； 新月**

> **waggle v.摇摆； n.摇摆**

> **coincide v.一致；复合**
    
Recruits also need to know the direction in which they should fly to arrive at the appropriate foraging location, and this information is communicated via the bee’s **angular** **orientation** to the hive. It, however, is not a direct connection to the position of the food supplies from the hive, but its location relative to the sun. Therefore if the food is situated directly opposite from the sun, the bee will fly a straight run vertically downward; if it is in the same direction as the sun, it will fly directly upward from the colony nest. A position 60 degrees to the right of the sun will prompt the bee to fly downwards at a 60 degrees angle toward the right of the nest. Moreover, because the sun is in constant motion throughout the day, the bee’s orientation will shift depending on the time at which the dance is performed. Sceptics of von Frisch’s findings, however, claim that visual cues are not enough to provide all the clues necessary to convey the location of a food resource. Several scientists, among them Adrian Wenner, believe that the dance is only one component of honeybee communications; **odour** is the second key element. Using robotic bees to perform the same dances, Wenner was unable to attract new recruits to the foraging activities; however, when he added a bit of nectar to the robot, workers quickly followed. He also discovered that the odors must be representative of the actual flowers containing the food source; otherwise the bees will arrive at the site, but not know which ones will be profitable.

> 招募者也需要知道他们应该飞到什么方向才能到达适当的觅食地点，这一信息是通过蜜蜂与蜂巢的角度方位来传达的。然而，它并不是直接连接到食物供给与蜂巢的位置，而是其相对于太阳的位置。因此，如果食物位于太阳的正对面，蜜蜂就会垂直向下直飞；如果食物与太阳的方向相同，它就会从蜂巢直接向上飞。在太阳右侧60度的位置，将促使蜜蜂以60度角向巢穴右侧飞下。此外，由于太阳在一天中是不断运动的，蜜蜂的方向会根据跳舞的时间而改变。然而，对冯-弗里施的发现持怀疑态度的人声称，视觉线索不足以提供传达食物资源位置所需的所有线索。一些科学家，其中包括阿德里安-温纳，认为舞蹈只是蜜蜂通信的一个组成部分；气味是第二个关键因素。使用机器人蜜蜂进行同样的舞蹈，Wenner无法吸引新成员参加觅食活动；然而，当他在机器人中加入一点花蜜时，工人们很快就跟上了。他还发现，气味必须代表含有食物来源的实际花朵；否则，蜜蜂会到达现场，但不知道哪些花朵会有收益。

> **odour n.（尤指难闻的）气味，臭味**


## Recent research

A. Recent research in Hong Kong indicates that staying in bed after a long week at school is just what children need to avoid becoming **obese**, The research, which focused on children aged five to fifteen, discovered that those who slept late on Saturdays and Sundays decreased the probability of having weight problems as they grew up. Published in the journal Paediatrics, the findings add to previous research that indicated a connection between regular sleep **deprivation** and obesity.

>香港最近的研究表明，在学校度过漫长的一周后躺在床上正是儿童避免变得肥胖所需要的。这项研究主要针对5至15岁的儿童，发现那些在周六和周日晚睡的儿童在长大后出现体重问题的概率降低。该研究结果发表在《儿科》杂志上，是对以前的研究的补充，这些研究表明经常性的睡眠**不足**与肥胖之间存在联系。

> **obese  adj.肥胖的，臃肿的**

> **deprivation n.贫困，匮乏，剥夺；免职**

B. The scientists involved believe the weekend lie-in is vital for school-age children to **catch up** on the sleep they lose during a busy week at school. This catch up sleep helps the children to **regulate** calorie consumption by cutting down on eating snacks during waking hours, Scientists and others in the medical fields have long known that a lack of sleep and irregular sleep patterns causes obesity as this combination affects the body’s natural **metabolism** and tends to also encourage snacking to reduce the feeling of tiredness. However, this is thought to be the first time researchers have found sleeping in at weekends to be a key factor in helping ‘reset’ children’s sleeping patterns.



> 有关科学家认为，周末躺在床上对学龄儿童来说是至关重要的，因为他们可以补回在学校忙碌的一周中失去的睡眠。这种补觉有助于儿童通过减少在清醒时间吃零食来调节热量消耗。科学家和医学领域的其他人士早就知道，缺乏睡眠和不规则的睡眠模式会导致肥胖，因为这种组合会影响身体的自然代谢，并往往会鼓励吃零食以减少疲倦感。然而，这被认为是研究人员首次发现周末睡觉是帮助 "重置 "儿童睡眠模式的一个关键因素。

> **catch up  v.赶上；把……缠住   catch up sleep 补觉**

> **regulate v. 调整；控制；管理**

> **metabolism n.新陈代谢**


C. Since the 1980s, obesity rates among children in the UK and in the United States have been on the rise and medical and childcare experts fear a **diabetes** and heart disease epidemic is developing. Although estimates for obesity rates have recently been lowered, current expectations are that close to one in three boys aged from two to eleven are likely to be overweight or obese by the year 2020. The prediction for girls is slightly over one in four, a much lower prediction than ten years ago when forecasts were that almost half would be overweight.

> 自20世纪80年代以来，英国和美国儿童的肥胖率一直在上升，医疗和儿童护理专家担心糖尿病和心脏病的流行正在形成。尽管对肥胖率的估计最近有所降低，但目前的预期是，到2020年，接近三分之一的2至11岁的男孩可能超重或肥胖。对女孩的预测是略高于四分之一，这比十年前的预测低得多，当时的预测是几乎一半的人将超重。


> **diabetes  n.糖尿病，多尿症**

D. The relationship between sleep **deficiency** and obesity has been drawing much attention in the past several years with studies showing that sleeping just a few hours a night can seriously disturb the body’s natural metabolism, leading to an increase in overall calorie intake and a much greater danger of weight-related illnesses. Yun Kwok Wing of Hong Kong University and other experts investigated the possibility that catching up on sleep at the weekends would help youngsters to overcome such disruption of the bodies metabolism. They questioned the parents of over 5,000 schoolchildren and accumulated data on diet, lifestyle, weight and sleeping habits. During school time, the average amount of sleep was a little over nine hours on average. However, a surprising number of kids slept well under eight hours a night.

>在过去几年中，睡眠不足和肥胖之间的关系一直备受关注，研究表明，每晚只睡几个小时就会严重扰乱身体的自然代谢，导致总的热量摄入增加，与体重有关的疾病的危险大大增加。香港大学的尹国荣和其他专家调查了在周末补觉是否能帮助年轻人克服身体新陈代谢的这种干扰。他们询问了5000多名学童的父母，并积累了有关饮食、生活方式、体重和睡眠习惯的数据。在学校期间，平均睡眠时间略高于9小时。然而，令人惊讶的是，许多孩子每晚的睡眠时间远远低于8小时。

> **deficiency n.缺乏，不足；缺陷，瑕疵；赤字**

E. What the researchers found most interesting was that those children who managed to catch up on missed sleep on the weekend actually remained relatively slim while those who did not had a higher probability of putting on weight (as measured by body mass index, or BMI). A report the researches published revealed: “Overweight and obese children tended to wake up earlier and had shorter sleep durations throughout weekdays, weekends and holidays than their normal-weight peers. Our study suggests sleeping longer on weekends or holidays could lower the risk of being overweight or obese.”

研究人员发现最有趣的是，那些设法在周末补回错过的睡眠的孩子实际上仍然相对苗条，而那些没有补回睡眠的孩子则有更高的发胖概率（以身体质量指数或BMI衡量）。研究人员发表的一份报告显示。"与正常体重的同龄人相比，超重和肥胖的儿童往往在整个工作日、周末和节假日更早醒来，睡眠时间更短。我们的研究表明，在周末或节假日睡得更久可以降低超重或肥胖的风险"。

F. The study authors mentioned that reduced sleep duration has become a **hallmark** of modern society, with people generally sleeping one to two hours less than a few decades ago and children were no exception to this. However, the researchers were not quite sure why obese and overweight children were less likely to sleep late on weekends, but indicated that they tended to spend more time doing their homework and watching television than their normal- weight peers. Still, the researchers urged caution in the interpretation of their findings, acknowledging that “an irregular sleep-wake schedule and insufficient sleep among school-aged children and adolescents has been documented with a variety of serious **repercussions**, including increased daytime sleepiness, academic difficulties, and mood and behavioral problems.”

> 研究作者提到，睡眠时间减少已经成为现代社会的一个标志，人们普遍比几十年前少睡一到两个小时，儿童也不例外。然而，研究人员并不十分确定为什么肥胖和超重儿童在周末不太可能睡得很晚，但表示他们往往比正常体重的同龄人花更多时间做作业和看电视。尽管如此，研究人员仍敦促在解释他们的发现时要谨慎，承认 "学龄儿童和青少年的不规则睡眠-觉醒时间表和睡眠不足已被记录在案，有各种严重的影响，包括白天嗜睡、学习困难、情绪和行为问题的增加。"

G. The precise nature of the link between short sleep duration and obesity remains unclear, said Mary A. Jackson, Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University’s Alpert Medical School in Providence, and Director of Chronobiology at Bradley Hospital in East Providence. “Evidence has shown that there are changes in **satiety** and in levels of the **hunger** **hormones** leptin and ghrelin,” Jackson said. “But there’s also evidence that kids who are not getting enough sleep get less physical activity, perhaps simply because they’re too tired. It’s just not cut-and-dried.” The findings could be of help in slowing down the ongoing increase in childhood obesity, but for the time being, parents should be **observant** of their children’s wake-sleep cycles, and take steps to ensure they are getting enough sleep, the researchers advised. Perhaps this is a reminder to us all that despite school, homework, extracurricular activities, and family time, sleep still needs to be a priority in a child’s life.

## TEAM BUILDING

Particularly in times of economic **downturn**, efficiency is of **supreme** importance across all industry bases; **whilst** companies may be looking to cut their costs, many still invest in staff motivation, training and development programmes, having developed an understanding of just how crucial strong internal relationships can be for success.

Louise Edwards of HR Success says that one of the barriers she comes across time and time again is that corporate heads often seem to understand that ‘team building’ is important but are not quite sure what it is or how to achieve it. In the terms of a sports club, she says, the team (i.e. what it is and how it is defined) is obvious and easy to identify. In contrast, she says, within a company – particularly a multi-layered, larger organisation, definitions may become more confused. Many define a business ‘team’ as the group of people who report to the same boss – a department, for example. However, according to Edwards, it is more productive to define a team as a group of people working towards a common goal. In training terms, therefore, this group could be members of a department with the same roles and responsibilities, such as a sales team with the common goal of selling or even the organisation as a whole, whose ‘goal’ in this case is the continued success of the organisation, their many different skills and roles all contributing to this in a number of ways.

> 人力资源成功公司的路易丝-爱德华兹说，她一再遇到的障碍之一是，企业负责人似乎知道 "团队建设 "很重要，但不太清楚它是什么，也不知道如何实现它。她说，就体育俱乐部而言，团队（即它是什么以及如何定义它）是显而易见的，很容易识别。她说，相比之下，在一个公司--特别是一个多层次的大型组织，定义可能会变得更加混乱。许多人将商业 "团队"定义为向同一个老板汇报的一群人，例如一个部门。然而，根据Edwards的说法，将团队定义为一群为共同目标而工作的人，会更有成效。因此，在培训方面，这个团队可以是具有相同角色和责任的部门成员，如具有共同销售目标的销售团队，甚至是整个组织，在这种情况下，他们的 "目标 "是组织的持续成功，他们的许多不同技能和角色都以多种方式对此做出贡献。

Brenda Durham of Corporate Trouble-Shooters believes it **inevitable** that to some extent conflict will exist in a successful workplace since the necessary diversity of skills and personalities required for success will also unavoidably lead to misunderstandings and **disharmony** from time to time. A **cohesive** unit that minimises friction, she believes, can however be developed in any organisation committed to investment in its people. Whilst the taking on of external expertise for staff training and team building programmes can be costly, a number of companies, particularly those with a robust human resources department, are undertaking the training themselves. Liaison Wizards, established in 2001 and headed by Jeff Blackshaw, offers free training and development advice to companies wishing to offer motivation **seminars** designed in house, in the belief that **contextualised** training is always more effective. The company’s own business model is based upon generating revenue from advertising on their popular website – a great success, so far, having surpassed financial projections for each year it has been in operation to date.

> Brenda Durham of Corporate Trouble-Shooters认为，在某种程度上，成功的工作场所不可避免地会存在冲突，因为成功所需的技能和个性的多样性也不可避免地会不时地导致误解和不和谐。然而，她认为，任何致力于投资于员工的组织都可以发展出一个具有凝聚力的单位，将摩擦降到最低。虽然聘请外部专家进行员工培训和团队建设计划的成本很高，但一些公司，特别是那些拥有强大人力资源部门的公司，正在自己进行培训。Liaison Wizards成立于2001年，由Jeff Blackshaw领导，为希望提供内部设计的激励研讨会的公司提供免费的培训和发展建议，因为他们相信结合实际的培训总是更加有效。该公司自己的商业模式是基于从其受欢迎的网站上的广告产生的收入--到目前为止，这是一个巨大的成功，到目前为止，每年的财务预测都超过了预期。

Blackshaw likens the key to successful corporate team building to the **tactics** employed in a less formal sporting environment. He says that bonds, connections and **empathy** developed between members of a **rugby** team, for example, can also be developed within a department in the business world or even at company level. He says that good team work is **fostered** by respect, encouragement, shared enthusiasm and a caring and supportive workplace. Trying to exploit or **dictate** to personnel is sure to lead to failure, Blackshaw says.

Brian Osbourne, Human Resources Director of Opmax Inc, believes that programmes developed in house are inherently more likely to be of greater success than external offerings for two main reasons. Most importantly, he says, people are much easier to motivate if they themselves can be involved in designing and deciding activities – this level of **consultation** at the planning stage being much easier to achieve for an internal department than an external consultant. Of only slightly less importance, says Osbourne, training activities must be perceived by participants as providing outcomes **geared** towards developing the individuals’ potential, Once again, programmes developed by people with an insight into the personalities and culture at hand can be more easily **tailored** to suit the **distinctive** needs of that particular audience.

> Opmax公司的人力资源总监布莱恩-奥斯本（Brian Osbourne）认为，内部开发的项目本来就比外部提供的项目更有可能获得更大的成功，主要有两个原因。他说，最重要的是，如果员工自己能够参与设计和决定活动，就更容易激发他们的积极性--在计划阶段，内部部门比外部顾问更容易实现这种协商水平。奥斯本说，最不重要的是，培训活动必须被参与者认为是为开发个人潜力而提供的成果。同样，由对个人性格和文化有深入了解的人制定的方案可以更容易适应特定受众的独特需求。

According to Osbourne, one of the biggest barriers to successful staff training is the **perception** that activities are too game-focussed, with no real objectives; many professionals, believing that such games are **trite** or **patronising**, are unable to appreciate the hidden benefits of building understanding and **camaraderie** within the group. If presented correctly, within the correct context and in **conjunction** with other, more **staid** approaches, Louise Edwards holds that games can be an enormous asset in staff training. In simple terms, Edwards defines the objectives of team building activities as a process, starting with the first stage – the clarification of the collective goals. This leads to the identification of the **inhibitors** preventing achievement of those goals and the introduction of enablers which will assist in goal achievement. This is followed by stage four – the final stage, where outcomes are measured and from that point on are monitored to ensure that goals are achieved and continue to be achieved. In stages 2 and 3 (identifying barriers and introducing positive alternatives) Edwards believes that the use of humour goes a long way towards relationship building on a personal level through development of empathy and removal of **antipathy**, ultimately fostering cooperation and support on a more formal level.

>奥斯本认为，成功的员工培训的最大障碍之一是认为活动过于注重游戏，没有真正的目标；许多专业人员认为这种游戏是老套的或光棍的，无法理解在小组内建立理解和友谊的隐藏好处。Louise Edwards认为，如果在正确的背景下，并与其他更呆板的方法相结合，游戏可以成为员工培训的巨大财富。简单地说，爱德华兹将团队建设活动的目标定义为一个过程，从第一阶段开始--明确集体目标。这导致了对阻碍实现这些目标的抑制因素的识别，以及对有助于实现目标的促进因素的引入。接下来是第四阶段--最后一个阶段，对结果进行衡量，并从那时起进行监测，以确保目标的实现和继续实现。在第二和第三阶段（识别障碍和引入积极的替代方案），爱德华兹认为，通过发展同理心和消除反感，使用幽默感对于在个人层面上建立关系有很大的帮助，最终在更正式的层面上促进合作和支持。

Alan Kidman, HR Manager of Tellam Industries agrees that the use of humour and games within a training context can go a long way towards helping an organisation achieve its goals. He has recently designed a two month long in house team building programme for senior management and will soon be delivering the first of a series of 8 **workshops** and activities. The goal of the project, he says, was to strengthen communication and support within the extremely diverse departments of the organisation. Heads of six departments, **collectively** responsible for over 200 staff members, are to **be involved in** the series of seminars. The programme, Kidman says, is experimental and if it proves to be a success is also intended for use in the organisation’s branches overseas. Previously the organisation has taken a more formalised approach to staff development training relying on methods such as **psychometric** testing discussions, motivational conferences and formal **appraisals**. The new, and as yet untried, approach will challenge participants in, by comparison, rather radical ways. One initiative, for example, requiring the writing, organisation and delivery of a **theatrical** performance to which all staff members will be invited to view.


> Tellam Industries的人力资源经理Alan Kidman也认为，在培训中使用幽默和游戏可以在很大程度上帮助一个组织实现其目标。他最近为高级管理层设计了一个为期两个月的内部团队建设计划，并将很快提供一系列8个讲习班和活动中的第一个。他说，这个项目的目标是加强该组织中极其多样化的部门之间的沟通和支持。六个部门的负责人，总共负责200多名员工，将参与这一系列的研讨会。基德曼说，这个计划是试验性的，如果它被证明是成功的，还打算在该组织的海外分支机构使用。以前，该组织采取了一种更正式的方法来进行员工发展培训，依靠的是心理测试讨论、激励会议和正式评估等方法。相比之下，新的、尚未尝试的方法将以相当激进的方式挑战参与者。例如，有一项举措要求编写、组织和提供一个戏剧表演，并邀请所有员工观看。

Team building and motivational approaches include a wide variety of methodologies, techniques, theories and tools. Experts generally agree that different options may succeed or fail depending upon the culture of the organisation in which they are implemented. A fit with the personalities involved in crucial to success. Not only is delivery of appropriate training **sessions** themselves important but professional and measurable follow up is also a must.

> 团队建设和激励方法包括各种各样的方法、技术、理论和工具。专家们普遍认为，不同的方案可能成功，也可能失败，这取决于实施方案的组织的文化。与相关人员的配合是成功的关键。不仅提供适当的培训课程本身很重要，专业和可衡量的后续行动也是必须的。
