## Practice One

Question: Some people think students should evaluate their teachers' job performance. Other believe that will lead a loss of respect and discipline. Discuss and give your opinion.

In this day and age, it is standard practice for business executive to fill out the performance-evaluation forms of their subordinates' work. When it comes to the evaluation of teacher's job by their students, people hold divergent views. Some argue that students should be allowed to evaluate their teacher work. Others believe disrespect and indiscipline will ensure if students evaluate teacher work. Personally, I contend both those two views have some merits. 

Grandly, there are some possible drawback to student evaluating their teachers work. Firstly, if not well-managed, evaluation by student will be worthless and misleading, it is manifest that  not all students could give their evaluation responsibly, and even some students make mean comment about teacher work. Secondly, Some students criticize  their teachers not because their teacher have a slack attitude about their job. Rather they do so because they dislike or despite schooling.

However, encouraging students to evaluate their teachers can bring more boons. In the first place, it is effective means of motivating teacher improving their lectures. Teachers have to keep adjusting their teaching to measure up to the expectation of their students.  In the second place, regular input affords the teacher objective and balance ideal about their performance.  Without those feedback, it is hard for teachers to have accurate assessment of their own teaching. In the third place, a measure of students' autonomy can make the student more better prepare for their adult life. The student becomes better at decision-making and critic-thinking.

In final analysis, I contend that enabling the student to evaluate their teacher has some drawback. however,by averaging out students' apprise and encourage them to evaluate responsibly can eliminate the downside of this practice. On balance, I am convinced that allowing students to evaluate their teachers is in the best interests of students, teachers, school administrator and society as whole.



## Practice two

Question: people today can perform the everyday tasks such as shopping, banking or even business transactions, without meeting others face-to-face. what effects will this phenomenon have on individuals and society as a whole?

The interactivity of the internet and the mobile phone enabled a multitude of people to purchase their desired items and pay a mobile phone bills without stepping out of offices and homes. And many others can register for tests and sign contracts online. The sweeping trend of going about everyday business in the virtual world has triggered a marked decline in face-to-face contact. thus, it is essential that we identify a implication of this trend on individuals and society as whole.

The impact of this phenomenon on individuals is profound. First, individuals' efficiency in business transaction and banking will be greatly enhanced. And those who dread shopping are spared the chore of browsing around in shops. Secondly, the increasingly sedentary lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of ailment. More overweight people means more patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases such as vein hardening, diabetes and hypertension. Thirdly, the absence of face-to-face contact may induce distrust between business partners. An inherent sense of disbelief is apt to ruin a telecommunicated negotiation when negotiators can only see videos of each other transmitted via the internet.

this trend also has widespread repercussions on society as a whole. In the first place, burgeoning e-commerce will, doubtless, boost corporate efficiency immeasurably. And higher efficiency means more earnings and low costs for businesses. In the second place, online fraud, be it banking or trading, retail or wholesale is sure to abound in the cyberspace. We must search for  practicable and effectual means of curbing it. In the third place, the proliferation of e-commerce may exacerbate man's overdependent on technology. And that can render our lives unspontaneous and our tempo of life too fast and furious.

In sum, it is no denying that the virtual world is exerting influence on our lives in various ways. it is a key that we take advantage of the upside of this trend and in the meantime mitigate its downside as much as possible.






## 小作文

**Tips:** 
> **<p style="color:red">The task is to describe what you see. Write a report. Don't give your opinions. because you don't know why the line on graph goes down or goes up, so the report has no conclusion. you can put a summary instead </p>**


- Question type

Line graph

Bar chart

Pie chart

Above four type is about number, you should describe/compare/changes/trends

- Essay structure (4 paragraphs)

**1. Introduction**

One sentence: paraphrase the question.


**2. Overview**

The main, general things

**3. Details**

**4. Details**

In three and four paragraph, This makes you organize or group  the information better.



### Line graph

**Tips: You will not see a graph with only one line, your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.**

> **Fist, make a very general comparison(summary/overview paragraph)**

**For example:**

# ![](images/1653713320(1).png)

if we take a graph with four lines, the overall summary would be something very very general,like saying that blue line is the highest overall is higher than the other lines overall

> **Second, compare the lines at specific points(this is your details paragraphs)**

there are many details that you could compare, I would start off at beginning with the first year and compare the number there, but then many other choices and you have to select what you think of the main things, you might choose this point where the blue line becomes the highest and stays the highest for the rest of the period. You might choose to describe and compare the different increases  or rise. You might choose the peaks on one or more of the lines. You might choose a stable period  on one of the lines like this one. there many things to say and you can't describe everything. So you have to select, my tips is write at least one thing about each line, make sure you do some comparisons and if you've got one or two things that you said about each line that should be okay.   

#### Line graph question

## ![](images/1653715445(1).png)

- **Introduction** - paraphrase the question

The line graph compares  the amount of electricity produced  in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years. 

- **Overview** - 2 sentences, 2 main points

It is clear that nuclear power was **by far(目前为止)** the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewable provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

- **Details** - 2 paragraphs,compare the lines

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 trawwatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. just one year later, nuclear power overtook termal power as the primary source of electricity.

Between 1980 and  2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.


**Warning:**

You can't write:

Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

You must write:

Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

I would notice than this is easily the highest figure mobile phone sales in shop a, and looking at shop b, I'd probably just say that the figures are similar for all four items,we are not going to give the number of sales, we are just going to talk in general about those highest or similar figures

> **Second, compare specific numbers(details paragraphs)**

### Bar chart question


# ![](images/1653725732(1).png)

- **Details** - 2 paragraphs,compare the lines

In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was almost double the number of handsets sold by the second most successful manufacture, Samsum. Over the following four years, however, Nokia's sales figures fell by approximately 200 million units, whereas Samsung saw sales rise by a similar amount. By 2013, Samsung had become the market leader with sales reaching 450 million units.

The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were LG,ZTE and Apple.

# ![](images/1653749040(1).png)


- **Introduction** - paraphrase the question

The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure in the UK and NewZealand in the years 1980 and 2008.


- **Overview** - 2 sentences, 2 main points

It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, Uk residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.



- **Details** - 2 paragraphs,compare the lines

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on food and drink, While the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both counties saw increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zeanland and from 26% to 28% in the Uk.

Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zeanlanders spent only half as much in relative terms on recreation(17%) as UK residents(34%). In both countries, transport costs and othe costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. there are no plans to change external walls or entrances.


- **Details** - 2 paragraphs,compare the lines


the most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and under stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.
