Introducing a buy/hold spread, with more stringent requirements for establishing positions than for maintaining them, is the most effective cost mitigation technique. Most anomalies with less than 50\\% turnover per month generate significant net spreads when designed to mitigate transaction costs; few with higher turnover do. The extent to which new capital reduces strategy profitability is inversely related to turnover, and strategies based on size, value, and profitability have the greatest capacity to support new capital. Transaction costs always reduce strategy profitability, increasing data-snooping concerns.Received January 28, 2015; accepted September 30, 2015 by Editor Andrew Karolyi.}",

With microcaps mitigated via NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, 65\\% of the 452 anomalies in our extensive data library, including 96\\% of the trading frictions category, cannot clear the single test hurdle of the absolute \\$t\\$-value of 1.96. Imposing the higher multiple test hurdle of 2.78 at the 5\\% significance level raises the failure rate to 82\\%. Even for replicated anomalies, their economic magnitudes are much smaller than originally reported. In all, capital markets are more efficient than previously recognized.Received June 12, 2017; editorial decision October 29, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.
